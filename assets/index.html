    <h2>setTimeout as a Service</h2>
    <p>
        Specify the amount of time (defaults to milliseconds) you want the server to sleep before responding.<br />
        Supports HTTP requests with the time being the path or socket connections on port 5103 with the time sent followed by a newline.<br />
        You can also send format modifiers like ?json, ?css, ?callback=test, ?js, ?int, ?gif. Feel free to use whatever subdomain you want too,<br />
        in case you're hitting the max parallel connections in a browser.
    </p>

    <h3>Use Cases</h3>
    <p>
        You can use this to see if certain parts of your app are blocking.<br />
        Adding a css timeout to a style tag can show you if a stylesheet could block your site from loading. Same thing with the a js<br />
        timeout as the src in script tag. The json option can be used with AJAX calls to test your render methods to see how they load.
    </p>

    <h3>HTTP Examples</h3>
    <p>http://settimeout.io/<strong>5000</strong> would sleep for 5000 milliseconds</p>
    <p>http://settimeout.io/<strong>10s?css</strong> would sleep for 10 seconds and return css</p>
    <p>http://settimeout.io/<strong>1h5s</strong> would sleep for 1 hour and 5 seconds</p>

    <h3>Socket Example</h3>
    <p>To sleep for 5000 milliseconds:</p>
    <pre>
    $ (echo "5000" && sleep 0.3) | nc settimeout.io 5103
    </pre>
